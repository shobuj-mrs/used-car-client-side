# The Car Buy&Sale 

* Keep in mind that a larger engine and a higher power rating will be worth more when gas prices are low but can result in a sale price reduction if the used car market favors fuel efficiency.Options like leather seats (assuming they‚Äôre in good condition), navigation, and alloy wheels can be used as selling points to enhance a vehicle‚Äôs value. Kelly Blue Book has provisions to include those extras in calculating an accurate value.

##  Advertising Tips and Tricks
* Once you‚Äôve decided to sell your car privately, it‚Äôs time to get the word out to the largest audience possible and sell a car online.

* Websites like Kelly Blue Book and Autotrader offer information on how to sell a car online and advertise classifieds services that put your car in front of thousands of active shoppers in your area in a matter of minutes. The car ads also run nationally for those hard-to-find vehicles. With a detailed description and several good photos, you can stand out to the buyers who are interested in your car.

* Selling your car online also allows you to field questions first, which will help you weed out any unlikely buyers and limit your time showing the car in person.

## State your asking price and negotiating terms

*  Begin by posting your car‚Äôs Blue Book¬Æ Value followed by your asking price, then give an explanation why you‚Äôre asking more or less than the Blue Book¬Æ Value. State whether the price is ‚Äúfirm,‚Äù ‚Äúnegotiable‚Äù or ‚Äúbest offer‚Äù ‚Äì as this will help you target buyers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
